		<p class="post-content">April 13, 2025, marked yet another meetup for the Bengaluru Postcrossing group — a familiar gathering in an unfamiliar setting. This time, we chose the <b>National Military Memorial</b> near Cubbon Road, right in the heart of Bengaluru. For many of us, this was our first visit to the location, and it turned out to be an intriguing choice — quiet, solemn, and steeped in significance.</p>
		<p class="post-content">The National Military Memorial is a tribute to the sacrifices made by India's armed forces. Set amid well-kept lawns and shady walkways, the memorial houses decommissioned military tanks, aircraft parts, rockets, and missile models, offering visitors a glimpse into India’s defense legacy. Its peaceful yet powerful atmosphere was a fitting backdrop for reflection — not just on military history, but on the day's broader historical importance.</p>
		<p class="post-content">Our meetup coincided with a solemn chapter in India’s past — <b>the anniversary of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre</b> that took place on 13 April 1919. On that tragic day, hundreds of innocent Indians were killed when British troops under General Dyer opened fire on a peaceful gathering in Amritsar. The incident became a defining moment in the Indian freedom struggle, sparking outrage, awakening national consciousness, and altering the course of resistance against colonial rule. As we gathered to celebrate our hobby, the date served as a quiet reminder of the resilience and sacrifice that shaped our nation’s path.</p>
		<p class="post-content">Back to the meetup — it was a casual, comfortable affair with <b>12 members in attendance</b>, all familiar faces from previous gatherings. We engaged in the <b>usual postcard signing</b>, exchanged excess philatelic materials, and shared stories about recent mail hauls and travel postcards. Though there were no new members this time, the unfamiliar venue added a refreshing twist to the otherwise routine proceedings.</p>
		<p class="post-content">After the formalities, we explored the memorial grounds, <b>clicking photos beside missile models, vintage military vehicles</b>, and memorial plaques. The imposing display of equipment stood in stark contrast to the gentle, reflective mood of the park, making it a surprisingly photogenic and educational location for a postcard gathering.</p>
		<p class="post-content">All in all, while the meetup may not have broken new ground in terms of attendees or activities, the setting made it memorable in its own way. Sometimes, even a small shift in the surroundings brings a breath of fresh air — and this time, it came with a reminder of valor, history, and remembrance.</p>
