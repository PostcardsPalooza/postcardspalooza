		<h2 class="post-title">EVOLUTION OF RUPEE 1 (1917-)</h2>

		<h4 class="side-heading">Introduction to the One-Rupee Note in India</h4>
		<p class="post-content">The one-rupee note holds a unique place in the history of Indian currency, being the smallest denomination issued and the only one 
			not issued by the Reserve Bank of India. This note reflects the country's economic history, symbolizing both continuity and change in the Indian 
			currency system.</p>

		<h4 class="side-heading">Introduction and Issuance</h4>
		<p class="post-content">The first one-rupee note in India was introduced on November 30, 1917, during World War I. It was introduced as a temporary measure 
			due to the severe shortage of silver, which was used to mint coins. The British government, then ruling India, decided to issue paper currency to 
			replace the silver rupee coins.</p>
		<p class="post-content">Unlike other denominations, the one-rupee note is issued by the Ministry of Finance, not the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). This 
			distinction has historical roots, as the note was originally introduced by the British government and has remained under government control even after 
			India's independence.</p>

		<h4 class="side-heading">Key Features and Design</h4>
		<p class="post-content">The design of the one-rupee note has undergone several changes over the decades. The first one-rupee note featured a portrait of 
			King George V and was printed by Thomas De La Rue & Company, a British security printing firm.</p>
		<p class="post-content">Over time, the design evolved, and post-independence, the note prominently featured the Ashoka Pillar, symbolizing India's 
			sovereignty. The reverse side of the note usually depicted motifs such as agricultural or industrial themes, reflecting India's development focus.</p>

		<h5 class="side-heading">Striking Differences with Other Denominations:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issuing Authority:</b> As mentioned earlier, the one-rupee note is unique because it is issued by the Ministry of Finance, while all 
				other denominations are issued by the RBI. This is indicated by the signature on the note, which is that of the Finance Secretary, as opposed to 
				the RBI Governor's signature on other notes.</li>
			<li><b>Legal Tender Status:</b> The one-rupee note is legal tender across India, but because of its low value, it is less frequently used in circulation 
				today. However, it is still recognized as official currency, unlike the higher denominations, which are more actively used in daily transactions.</li>
			<li><b>Historical Significance:</b> The one-rupee note has historical significance as it represents continuity from the British colonial period to 
				independent India. It also serves as a reminder of the economic strategies employed during times of scarcity.</li>
		</ul>		

		<h4 class="side-heading">Reintroduction and Current Status</h4>
		<p class="post-content">After being discontinued in 1994 due to the high cost of printing relative to its value, the one-rupee note was reintroduced in 
			2015. The new notes were designed to reflect modern India, with the front featuring the numeral "1" in 15 languages and the back displaying an image of 
			the Sagar Samrat oil rig, symbolizing India's industrial prowess.</p>
